# Hate Speech Intensity Prediction (Exploratory Codebase)

This repository contains code for studying **hate speech intensity and escalation**
in Twitter reply chains using temporal, contextual, and graph-based representations.

The focus of this project is **not binary hate classification**, but understanding how hate
*emerges and intensifies over the course of a conversation*.

This codebase was developed as part of an academic project and primarily serves as a
**research and learning-oriented implementation**, rather than a polished production system.
